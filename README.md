Summary: COVID-19 resulted in enormous disruption to life around the world. To quell disease spread, governments implemented lockdowns that likely created hardships for households. 
To improve knowledge of consequences, we examine how the pandemic period was associated with household hardships and assess factors associated with these hardships. We conducted a cross-sectional study using quasi-Poisson regression 
to examine factors associated with household hardships. Data were collected between August and September of 2021 from a random sample of 880 households living within a Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) located in the 
Harari Region and the District of Kersa, both in Eastern Ethiopia.
